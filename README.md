# Disk-Scheduling
Disk Scheduling  algorithms (FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, C-SCAN, LOOK and C-LOOK) as well as the newly optimized  algorithm by implementing their algorithms and applying it on a disk queue with requests for I/O  blocks on cylinders and visualizing the head movements by using jframe and jcommon jars.
